abstract = {HIV-1 coreceptor usage must be accurately determined before starting CCR5 antagonist-based treatment as the presence of undetected minor CXCR4-using variants can cause subsequent virological failure. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing of HIV-1 V3 env allows to detect low levels of CXCR4- using variants that current genotypic approaches miss. However, the computation of the mass of sequence data and the need to identify true minor variants while excluding artifactual sequences generated during amplification and ultra-deep pyrosequencing is rate-limiting. Arbitrary fixed cut- offs below which minor variants are discarded are currently used but the errors generated during ultra-deep pyrosequencing are sequence-dependant rather than random. We have developed an automated processing of HIV-1 V3 env ultra-deep pyrosequencing data that uses biological filters to discard artifactual or non-functional V3 sequences followed by statistical filters to determine position-specific sensitivity thresholds, rather than arbitrary fixed cut-offs. It allows to retain authentic sequences with point mutations at V3 positions of interest and discard artifactual ones with accurate sensitivity thresholds.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presence of low-frequency HIV-1 variants with mutations making them resistant to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) could influence the virological response to first-line NNRTI therapy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: This study was designed to describe the proportions and quantities of NRTI and NNRTI-resistant variants in patients with successful first-line NNRTI therapy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN: We evaluated the presence of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) prior to treatment initiation in 131 naive chronically HIV-1-infected patients initiating NNRTI-based first-line therapy. DRMs were detected by ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS) on a GS Junior instrument (Roche).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean HIV RNA concentration was 4.78±0.74logcopies/mL and the mean CD4 cell count was 368±184 CD4cells/mm(3). Patients were mainly infected with subtype B (68{\%}) and 96{\%} were treated with efavirenz. The sensitivity threshold for each mutation was 0.13-1.05{\%} for 2000 reads. Major NRTI-resistant or NNRTI-resistant mutations were detected in 40 patients (33.6{\%}). The median frequency of major NRTI-resistant mutations was 1.37{\%} [IQR: 0.39-84.1], i.e.: a median of 556copies/mL [IQR: 123-37,553]. The median frequency of major NNRTI-resistant DRMs was 0.78{\%} [IQR: 0.67-7.06], i.e.: a median of 715copies/mL [IQR: 391-3452]. The genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) of 9 (7.3{\%}) patients with mutations to given treatment detected by UDPS was 1.5 or 2.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: First-line NNRTI-based treatment can produce virological success in na{\"{\i}}ve HIV-1-infected patients harboring low-frequency DRMs representing <1{\%} of the viral quasispecies. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical cut-off of low-frequency resistant variants associated to virological failure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To track changes in the V3 env region of HIV-1 quasispecies and determine virus coreceptor use in cell reservoirs of patients on long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients whose plasma viraemia had been suppressed for a median of 5.5 years were followed for 5 years. The V3 env regions of viruses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed by ultra-deep sequencing (UDS). HIV-1 tropism was predicted using the geno2pheno 5.75 algorithm and a phenotypic assay.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The UDS and phenotypic assay data were concordant for predicting HIV-1 tropism. CXCR4-using viruses detected by UDS accounted for 14.7{\%}-76.5{\%} of the virus populations in samples from five patients at enrolment. Five patients harboured pure R5 virus populations and no X4 viruses emerged during the 5 years. The selection pressures estimated by the dN/dS ratio were acting on the V3 region to produce diversification of the quasispecies in CXCR4-infected patients and purification of the quasispecies in R5-infected patients on effective ART.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: UDS showed that the virus quasispecies in cell reservoirs of patients on long-term suppressive ART continued to evolve. CXCR4-using variants became more diversified. Analysis of the selection pressures on the virus quasispecies could provide a clearer picture of virus persistence in patients on effective ART.},

abstract = {Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by distinctive facial features, learning difficulties, and macrocephaly with frequent pre- and postnatal overgrowth with advanced bone age. Here, we report on our experience in the molecular diagnostic of Sotos syndrome on 116 patients. Using direct sequencing and a quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF)-based assay allowing accurate detection of both total and partial NSD1 deletions, we identified NSD1 abnormalities in 104 patients corresponding to 102 Sotos families (90{\%}). NSD1 point mutations were detected in 80{\%} of the index cases, large deletions removing the NSD1 gene entirely in 14{\%}, and intragenic NSD1 rearrangements in 6{\%}. Among the 69 detected distinct point mutations, 48 were novel. The QMPSF assay detected an exonic duplication and a mosaic partial deletion. QMPSF mapping of the 15 large deletions revealed the heterogeneity of the deletions, which vary in size from 1 to 4.5 Mb. Clinical features of NSD1-positive Sotos patients revealed that the phenotype in patients with nontruncating mutations was less severe that in patients with truncating mutations. This study confirms the heterogeneity of NSD1 alterations in Sotos syndrome and therefore the need to complete sequencing analysis by screening for partial deletions and duplications to ensure an accurate molecular diagnosis of this syndrome.},
