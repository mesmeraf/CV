abstract = {Received 26 July 2018; returned 18 September 2018; revised 29 October 2018; accepted 8 November 2018 Objectives: To determine how the load of rilpivirine-resistant variants (mutational load) influences the virologic- al response (VR) of HIV-1-infected patients to a rilpivirine-based first-line regimen. Patients and methods: Four hundred and eighty-nine patients infected with HIV-1 whose reverse transcriptase gene had been successfully resistance genotyped using next-generation sequencing were given a first-line regi- men containing rilpivirine. Variables associated with the VR at 12months were identified using a logistic model. The results were used to build a multivariate model for each mutational load threshold and the R2 variations were analysed to identify the mutational load threshold that best predicted the VR. Results: The mutational load at baseline was the only variable linked to the VR at 12months (P ,0.01). The VR at 12months decreased from 96.9{\%} to 83.4{\%} when the mutational load was .1700 copies/mL and to 50{\%} when the mutational load was .9000copies/mL. The threshold of 9000copies/mL was associated with the VR at 12months with an OR of 36.7 (95{\%} CI 4.7–285.1). The threshold of 1700copies/mL was associated with the VR at 12months with anOR of 7.2 (95{\%} CI 1.4–36.8). Conclusions: There is quantifiable evidence that determining a mutational load threshold can be used to iden- tify those patients on a first-line regimen containing rilpivirine who are at risk of virological failure. The clinical management of HIV-infected patients can be improved by evaluating the frequency of mutant variants at a threshold of,20{\%} together with the plasma HIV-1 viral load at the time of resistance genotyping.},

abstract = {The present study compares the performances of an in-house sequencing protocol on MiSeq to those of the Sanger method, and the 454 GS-FLX for detecting and quantifying drug-resistant mutations in the HIV polymerase gene (reverse transcriptase and protease). MiSeq sequencing identified all the resistance mutations detected by bulk sequencing (n=84). The MiSeq and 454 GS-FLX platforms both identified 67 drug-resistant mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease regions, but a further 25 drug-resistant mutations were seen by only one or other of them. Pearson analysis showed good concordance between the percentage of drug resistant variants determined by MiSeq and 454 GS-FLX sequencing ($\rho$=0.77, p{\textless}0.0001). The MiSeq platform is as accurate as the 454 GS-FLX Roche system for determining RT and PR DRMs and could be used for monitoring HIV-1 drug resistance. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV‐3) can lead to chronic infection in immunocompro- mised patients, and ribavirin is the treatment of choice. Recently, mutations in the polymerase gene have been associated with ribavirin failure but their frequency before treatment according to HEV‐3 subtypes has not been studied on a large data set. We used single‐molecule real‐time sequencing technology to sequence 115 new complete genomes of HEV‐3 infecting French patients. We analyzed phylogenetic relationships, the length of the polyproline region, and mutations in the HEV polymer- ase gene. Eighty‐five (74{\%}) were in the clade HEV‐3efg, 28 (24{\%}) in HEV‐3chi clade, and 2 (2{\%}) in HEV‐3ra clade. Using automated partitioning of maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees, complete genomes were classified into subtypes. Polyproline region length differs within HEV‐3 clades (from 189 to 315 nt). Investigating muta- tions in the polymerase gene, distinct polymorphisms between HEV‐3 subtypes were found (G1634R in 95{\%} of HEV‐3e, G1634K in 56{\%} of HEV‐3ra, and V1479I in all HEV‐3efg, clade HEV‐3ra, and HEV‐3k strains). Subtype‐specific polymorphisms in the HEV‐3 polymerase have been identified. Our study provides new complete genome sequences of HEV‐3 that could be useful for comparing strains circulating in humans and the animal reservoir. KEYWORDS},

abstract = {The coreceptor used by HIV-1 must be determined before a CCR5 antagonist, part of the arsenal of antiretroviral drugs, is prescribed because viruses that enter cells using the CXCR4 coreceptor are responsible for treatment failure. HIV-1 tropism is also correlated with disease progression and so must be determined for virological studies. Tropism can be determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS), but not all of these new technologies have been fully validated for use in clinical practice. The Illumina NGS technology is used in many laboratories but its ability to predict HIV-1 tropism has not been evaluated while the 454 GS-Junior (Roche) is used for routine diagnosis. The genotypic prediction of HIV-1 tropism is based on sequencing the V3 region and interpreting the results with an appropriate algorithm. We compared the performances of the MiSeq (Illumina) and 454 GS-Junior (Roche) systems with a reference phenotypic assay. We used clinical samples for the NGS tropism predictions and assessed their ability to quantify CXCR4-using variants. The data show that the Illumina platform can be used to detect minor CXCR4-using variants in clinical practice but technical optimization are needed to improve quantification.},

abstract = {HIV-1 coreceptor usage must be accurately determined before starting CCR5 antagonist-based treatment as the presence of undetected minor CXCR4-using variants can cause subsequent virological failure. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing of HIV-1 V3 env allows to detect low levels of CXCR4- using variants that current genotypic approaches miss. However, the computation of the mass of sequence data and the need to identify true minor variants while excluding artifactual sequences generated during amplification and ultra-deep pyrosequencing is rate-limiting. Arbitrary fixed cut- offs below which minor variants are discarded are currently used but the errors generated during ultra-deep pyrosequencing are sequence-dependant rather than random. We have developed an automated processing of HIV-1 V3 env ultra-deep pyrosequencing data that uses biological filters to discard artifactual or non-functional V3 sequences followed by statistical filters to determine position-specific sensitivity thresholds, rather than arbitrary fixed cut-offs. It allows to retain authentic sequences with point mutations at V3 positions of interest and discard artifactual ones with accurate sensitivity thresholds.},

abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) can lead to chronic infection in solid-organ transplant patients. Ribavirin is efficient for treatment of chronically infected patients. Recently, the1634R mutation in the HEV polymerase has been associated with treatment failure. However, it is unclear if this mutation can be used as a prognostic marker of treatment outcome. We studied the prevalence of the 1634R mutation in the HEV polymerase of patients starting ribavirin therapy, the influence of the 1634R variants on the viral response, the frequency of the 1634R mutation in patients whose treatment failed, and its impact on ribavirin retreatment. We analyzed pretreatment samples from 63 solid-organ transplant patients with chronic hepatitis E using deep sequencing; 42 patients had a sustained virologic response (SVR), and 21 were non-SVR patients. We detected the 1634R variant by deep sequencing in 36.5{\%} (23/63) of the patients (proportions, 1.3 to 100{\%}). The 1634R variant was detected in 31.0{\%} (13/42) of baseline plasma samples from patients with SVR and in 47.6{\%} (10/21) in the other patients ( P = 0.2). The presence of this mutation did not influence the initial decrease in viral RNA. Lastly, a second prolonged ribavirin treatment led to SVR in 70{\%} of the patients who initially did not have SVR, despite the presence of the 1634R variant. We conclude that the presence of the 1634R variant at ribavirin initiation does not lead to absolute ribavirin resistance. Although its proportion increased in patients whose treatment failed, the presence of the 1634R variant did not compromise the response to a second ribavirin treatment.},

DRMs were detected by ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS) on a GS Junior instrument (Roche).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean HIV RNA concentration was 4.78±0.74logcopies/mL and the mean CD4 cell count was 368±184 CD4cells/mm(3). Patients were mainly infected with subtype B (68{\%}) and 96{\%} were treated with efavirenz. The sensitivity threshold for each mutation was 0.13-1.05{\%} for 2000 reads. Major NRTI-resistant or NNRTI-resistant mutations were detected in 40 patients (33.6{\%}). The median frequency of major NRTI-resistant mutations was 1.37{\%} [IQR: 0.39-84.1], i.e.: a median of 556copies/mL [IQR: 123-37,553]. The median frequency of major NNRTI-resistant DRMs was 0.78{\%} [IQR: 0.67-7.06], i.e.: a median of 715copies/mL [IQR: 391-3452].

The V3 env regions of viruses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed by ultra-deep sequencing (UDS). HIV-1 tropism was predicted using the geno2pheno 5.75 algorithm and a phenotypic assay.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The UDS and phenotypic assay data were concordant for predicting HIV-1 tropism. CXCR4-using viruses detected by UDS accounted for 14.7{\%}-76.5{\%} of the virus populations in samples from five patients at enrolment. Five patients harboured pure R5 virus populations and no X4 viruses emerged during the 5 years. The selection pressures estimated by the dN/dS ratio were acting on the V3 region to produce diversification of the quasispecies in CXCR4-infected patients and purification of the quasispecies in R5-infected patients on effective ART.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: UDS showed that the virus quasispecies in cell reservoirs of patients on long-term suppressive ART continued to evolve.

abstract = {Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by distinctive facial features, learning difficulties, and macrocephaly with frequent pre- and postnatal overgrowth with advanced bone age. Here, we report on our experience in the molecular diagnostic of Sotos syndrome on 116 patients. Using direct sequencing and a quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF)-based assay allowing accurate detection of both total and partial NSD1 deletions, we identified NSD1 abnormalities in 104 patients corresponding to 102 Sotos families (90{\%}). NSD1 point mutations were detected in 80{\%} of the index cases, large deletions removing the NSD1 gene entirely in 14{\%}, and intragenic NSD1 rearrangements in 6{\%}. Among the 69 detected distinct point mutations, 48 were novel. The QMPSF assay detected an exonic duplication and a mosaic partial deletion. QMPSF mapping of the 15 large deletions revealed the heterogeneity of the deletions, which vary in size from 1 to 4.5 Mb. Clinical features of NSD1-positive Sotos patients revealed that the phenotype in patients with nontruncating mutations was less severe that in patients with truncating mutations. This study confirms the heterogeneity of NSD1 alterations in Sotos syndrome and therefore the need to complete sequencing analysis by screening for partial deletions and duplications to ensure an accurate molecular diagnosis of this syndrome.},
